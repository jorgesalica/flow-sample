# The Observer's Toolkit: What You Can Do

This application is not just a script; it is a set of lenses designed to observe your musical history without altering it. Here is how you can interact with your flow:

## 1. Capture the Echo (Export)
You can cast a net into the Spotify API to retrieve your "Liked Songs".
*   **What it does**: It travels back in time, page by page, collecting every track you've ever saved.
*   **The Result**: A raw, unfiltered archive of your listening history. The foundation of your emotional trail.

## 2. Deepen the Context (Enrich)
You can ask the system to listen closer. It doesn't just see a song title; it looks for the connections.
*   **What it does**: It fetches the album details, the artist's genres, and the release dates. It asks "Where did this come from?" and "Who made this?".
*   **The Result**: A rich dataset where every song is anchored in its era and style. The "Pop" song becomes "Synth-pop from 1984".

## 3. Distill the Essence (Compact)
You can strip away the noise of the industry (markets, available codes, external URLs) to keep only what matters to the memory.
*   **What it does**: It creates a lightweight version of your data, perfect for quick reading or sharing.
*   **The Result**: A `compact.json` that holds the soul of the track without the weight of the metadata.

## 4. Navigate the Landscape (UI)
You can stop looking at a spreadsheet and start walking through the terrain.
*   **What it does**: The local interface (`pnpm dev`) renders your data as a visual grid.
*   **The Result**:
    *   **See the Eras**: Visual tags and charts tell you if a song is from the "90s" or a "Fresh wave".
    *   **Feel the Weight**: Metrics, Infinite Scroll, and Charts show your total volume and top genres.
    *   **Drift**: Scroll infinitely through your history, filter by genre or year, and explore your musical eras.
