## Project Origin

The project began as an exploration of **data flows** — ways to extract, transform, and visualize data from various sources.

**Spotify Flow** was the first:

- Fetch liked songs from Spotify API
- Enrich with artist genres
- Save to database
- Visualize in a web UI

The name "Flow Sample" reflects its nature: a sample implementation of the flow concept, meant to be extended with more flows in the future.
