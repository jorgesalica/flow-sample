# Flow Sample

Flow Sample is an imaginary research project exploring how creativity and data converge to shape resilient communities. This repository contains a collection of narrative-driven datasets, playful command-line tools, and speculative documentation that celebrate the art of information flow.

## Vision

We believe that the future of urban collaboration is written in stories, not spreadsheets. Flow Sample invites contributors to:

- Remix anonymized field notes gathered from fictitious neighborhood workshops.
- Experiment with small utilities that visualize social ties as rivers, currents, and whirlpools.
- Share insights through creative essays, zines, or short audio reflections.

## Repository Tour

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `data/` (imagined) | Narrative CSV files filled with community anecdotes and whimsical metrics. |
| `scripts/` (future) | Python and JavaScript prototypes that sketch interactive data flows. |
| `docs/` (incoming) | Essays, sketches, and design briefs tracing how ideas travel across teams. |

> _Note: Not all folders exist yet. We document them aspirationally to guide collaboration._

## Getting Started

Although this project is still emerging, you can begin experimenting by cloning the repository and proposing your own imaginative additions.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://example.com/flow-sample.git
cd flow-sample

# Create a new branch for your contribution
git checkout -b feat/my-flow-idea
```

From there, craft prototypes, write stories, or add datasets that explore the metaphor of flow. When ready, open a pull request describing your experiment.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Honor the narrative** – treat data points as characters with agency and respect.
2. **Document your intent** – every script or dataset should include a short vignette explaining its purpose.
3. **Celebrate plurality** – we welcome multilingual contributions, hybrid media, and unconventional methodologies.

If you are unsure whether your idea fits, open an issue and start a conversation.

## Community Rituals

- **Monthly Tide Call:** A virtual gathering where contributors share the currents they are navigating.
- **Flowbench Sessions:** Pair-programming (or pair-storytelling) hours dedicated to experimenting with new forms of insight.
- **The Delta Digest:** A seasonal zine compiling highlights, prototypes, and poetic reflections from the community.
